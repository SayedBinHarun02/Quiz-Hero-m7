                                Map executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the
                                updated elements.
                                Filter checks every element in an array to see if it meets specific criteria and returns
                                a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                                ForEach is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not
                                change the array and it returns undefined.
                                Find method returns the value of the first element that passes a test and it executes a
                                function for each array element.

                                The most current method is local storage. Although more data can be stored, when the
                                browser is closed, the data is not destroyed. Data that the user will need to access
                                later, such as offline data, can be stored in local storage.
                                Similar to cookies, session storage only saves information for the current session. The
                                data will be erased when the user exits the browser, according to this. Sensitive data,
                                including login passwords, can be stored using session storage.
                                The oldest and best-known mechanism is cookies. They are easy to use and have strong
                                browser support. They can only hold 4KB of information, though, and are frequently used
                                to store non-sensitive information like user preferences.

                                The key to JavaScript's asynchronous programming is the event loop. JS only uses one
                                thread for all tasks, but by utilizing a few clever data structures, it provides the
                                appearance of multi-threading.
                                The sole task of the event loop is to keep track of the call stack and callback queue.
                                The Event Loop will pull the first event from the queue and put it to the Call Stack,
                                which will then execute it if the Call Stack is empty.
                                In the Event Loop, such an iteration is referred to as a tick. Simply put, every event
                                is a function callback

                                Choose quiz function match the option that we have chosen with the answer stored. It
                                displays the correct answer and also the incorrect answer.
                                Quiz timer function keeps a record of the time that takes to complete the quiz, and
                                after submission, it shows the amount of time that took for the quiz.
